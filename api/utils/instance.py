    """
    Takes a Creature out of an Instance, whatever the reason.

    Used by the leave route today; death ejection will call it with the same
    arguments. The caller is responsible for the HTTP answer and the Discord
    queue message. Exceptions propagate to the caller.

    In order:
    - if other players remain, record the Creature in Instance.leavers
      (no re-entry) BEFORE detaching: if this fails, the Creature stays inside
      and the caller's "leave KO" answer is true;
    - detach the Creature (instance/x/y None);
    - purge every Redis key of the Creature (PA pools, actives, ammo);
    - if the Creature was the last player: kill every monster (ai-creature
      pubsub, then delete) and delete the Instance.

    :param creature: The leaving Creature.
    :param instance: The Instance being left.

    :return: 'closed' when the Instance was deleted, 'left' otherwise.
