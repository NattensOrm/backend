# This used to be a symlink to a connector shared with auth/discord
# (_redis/redis.py). Each service now keeps its own real copy, trimmed to
# what it actually calls - api uses the full surface here (PA, pub/sub,
# queueing), so this file is unchanged in content, just no longer a
# symlink. See api/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's "Redis usage" for why.

# Left unconfigured, redis-py defaults to a 100-connection pool that raises
# MaxConnectionsError as soon as it's exhausted - fine at low concurrency,
# but a service popping hundreds/thousands of concurrent workers (e.g. ai's
# one-thread-per-creature model) can blow past that fast. A blocking pool
# makes callers wait briefly for a free connection instead of failing
# outright, and the size is tunable per-deployment via env var.
